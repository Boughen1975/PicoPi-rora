PicoPi-rora allows you to connect to the AuroraWatch UK API (version 0.1) and download a set of data for aurora activity over the last 24 hours.
Using this data, PicoPi-rora displays a chart of activity on the Pico Display Pack 2 screen connected to a Raspberry Pico.

Other notable funcrtions contained withing the application are:
- Refresh button
- Info button (ip address, power level (useful if running on 3 x AA batteries), and wifi signal strength indicator (can be useful when siting the device to ensure good connection).
- Screen brightness (up and down) Setting is stored on the device so the choosen brightness level is retained following a power off.
- A reset button is connected to pins 28 & 30 (RUN and GND). This can be used to cycle the Pico in the event it gets hung (can occur waiting for wifi connection).
